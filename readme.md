Node ClassLoader

Why Node? Something new to learn, and it being js, it should be able to handle js.

As before, with the PHP version:

0. Setup
  - Create a file that is in the format you want
  - Create a file in the format it should be
1. Load all js files from source 
  - load them as javascript, and be able to write them out again
2. Parse packages
  - Build objects by the called functions
3. Resolve dependencies
4. Declare Namespaces
5. Write inheritence function
6. Write the source to the output

Since you don't want node to be the server, use PHP to call node from commandline
